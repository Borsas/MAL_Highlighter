# MAL Highlighter

MAL Highlighter is a userscript for myanimelist.net that allows the user to see clearly which animes or mangas they have added to their lists by coloring them differently.

## Usage
Add the script to your favourite userscript extension eg. Tampermonkey.

You also need to be logged-in to Myanimelist for the script to be able to work. If you are not logged-in you are only able to change the settings.
